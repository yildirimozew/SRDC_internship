# SRDC_internship
Code I wrote during my internship at Software Research and Development Consultancy. 
Part 1 is a custom protocol java and postgresql based server and client messaging app (works on terminal on both sides). 
Part 2 is the same app made with spring boot, postgresql, JDBC and plain html css javascript.
Part 3 is the same app made with MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS).
Every part adds additional functionality and abstraction to the application.
